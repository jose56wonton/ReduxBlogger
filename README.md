# Redux Blogger

This is a very simple app I made since I am learning Redux. It is kinda a blogging application but I could be used for a lot of things.

## Libraries used

* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) (for SAPP framework)
* [Redux](https://momentjs.com/) (for redux stuff :D)
* [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) (for AJAX)
* [Milligram](https://bulma.io/) (for CSS framework)
